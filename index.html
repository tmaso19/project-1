   <img src="./img/Chicken-Madeira.jpg" width="400" alt="">
   <p>Growing up my mom and I always would go to Grand Lux Cafe and get the chicken madiera. We would always split it and get an extra side of mashed potatoes and sauce. It became a sort of tradition between us, something only me and her would do. So whenever I think of this recipe or eat chicken madeira I think of her and our little tradition. There are times where I can't always go out to eat. So here is the recipe for those days when I'm really craving my comfort food but can't go get it!</p>

    <h3>Inscructions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li> To blanch asparagus: Remove fibrous stems from asparagus by snapping them off. Fill a medium pot with 6 cups water, bring to a boil and add 1 Tbsp salt. Add asparagus and boil uncovered until crisp tender and bright green (2-3 minutes then remove from hot water and set aside).</li>
      <li> Place a large heavy (oven-safe) pan over medium/high heat and melt in 2 Tbsp butter and 1 Tbsp oil. Add sliced mushrooms and cook 5 min until soft. Stir in diced onion and cook 3 min. Add minced garlic cloves then season with 1/4 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp black pepper and 2 Tbsp parsley. Cook another 2 min then remove mixture to a plate and wipe skillet clean with wet paper towel.</li>
      <li> Slice chicken breasts in half lengthwise and pound each cutlet between plastic wrap until no more than 1/4" thick. Season chicken all over with 1/2 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp black pepper. Place same pan over medium/high heat and add 1 Tbsp butter and 1 Tbsp oil. When butter is finished foaming, add chicken breasts and saut√© 3 to 4 min per side or until golden and cooked through. Remove chicken from pan to the same plate with mushrooms.</li>
      <li> In the same pan, add 1 1/2 cups Madeira and boil until reduced by half (5 minutes vigorous boiling), scraping the bottom of the pan to deglaze. Add 1 1/2 cups beef broth and boil until 2/3 cup liquid remains or about 1/4 of it's original volume (10 min). Reduce heat to medium, add 1/2 cup cream and simmer until sauce thickens (2 min). Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
      <li> Return chicken to the pan, turning it to coat in the sauce. Top with mushrooms, asparagus and sprinkle with 1 cup of mozzarella cheese over the top. Broil 3-4 minutes or until cheese is melted. Remove from oven, garnish with fresh parsley.</li>
    </ol>
